#Lab Escape
This is a full stack project I've designed to take through a code camp I'm attending. I wanted to replicate the feeling of an old MUD or MUSH, while providing an updated interface.
The initial push has dynamically mutating enemies, 7 crafting recipes, 9 consumable items and 25 enemies. They are all kept in an postgreSQL database as of the first commit, but will eventually be put into containers for a more accessible release. Please send me any comments/suggestions on how to improve my code, or thoughts on features to add. 
##Known Bugs
Occasionally the map will generate with no exits in the starting room or no path to the elevator.
